
Hi Hiring Manager/Recruiter,

I am excited to apply for the Data Engineer position at Atlassian. With seven years of experience in end-to-end data engineering, I have worked across business and delivery teams, as well as platform teams, focusing on development, enhancement, building new modules, and leading production support across all time shifts.

My expertise spans designing and optimizing data warehouses, creating Data Marts, implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions on enterprise platforms, and architecting scalable data pipelines using PySpark. I have performed extensive PySpark optimizations using Ganglia for performance tuning, ensuring efficient data processing. Additionally, I have successfully resolved API throttling challenges, a common industry-wide issue, optimizing CloudWatch and EMR API interactions. I also addressed RDS contention issues, ensuring optimal database performance.

My AWS expertise includes S3, EC2, EMR, Glue, Lambda, IAM, Athena, and KMS, leveraging these services for data ingestion, transformation, and storage. I have executed multiple POCs, including Hudi for incremental data processing, Redshift for analytical workloads, and CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment. Additionally, I developed ingestion pipelines utilizing urllib for efficient data retrieval and processing.

Atlassian's commitment to innovation and seamless collaboration aligns perfectly with my approach to scalable data solutions. I am eager to bring my expertise in AWS, PySpark, and data engineering to drive impactful insights and efficiencies within your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with Atlassianâ€™s needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Thanks,
Prakhar Vishnoi
